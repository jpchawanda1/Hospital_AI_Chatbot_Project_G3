    "# Hospital AI Agent System - Comprehensive Analysis & Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook presents a complete analysis and implementation of an **advanced NLP-enhanced Hospital AI Agent System** designed to provide intelligent medical information assistance for major healthcare facilities in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Patients in Kenya face significant challenges accessing accurate, timely medical information about hospital services, pricing, appointment procedures, and emergency contacts. Traditional information systems are often fragmented, outdated, or difficult to navigate, leading to:\n",
    "- Extended wait times for basic inquiries\n",
    "- Difficulty finding appropriate medical services\n",
    "- Confusion about hospital procedures and pricing\n",
    "- Limited access to emergency contact information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "1. **Develop an intelligent AI agent** capable of understanding natural language medical queries\n",
    "2. **Implement advanced NLP techniques** including Sentence Transformers and semantic similarity\n",
    "3. **Create a comprehensive medical knowledge base** with 1,000+ verified Q&A pairs\n",
    "4. **Deploy a production-ready system** with Docker containerization and monitoring\n",
    "5. **Achieve high accuracy** in medical information retrieval (>90% intent classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance & Innovation\n",
    "This project represents a significant advancement in healthcare information accessibility, combining:\n",
    "- **State-of-the-art NLP** with medical domain expertise\n",
    "- **Real hospital data** from Nairobi Hospital and Kenyatta National Hospital\n",
    "- **Multi-modal deployment** (GUI, API, containerized services)\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning** for continuous improvement through user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Hospitals\n",
    "- **Nairobi Hospital** (Private) - Argwings Kodhek Road, Hurlingham\n",
    "- **Kenyatta National Hospital** (Public) - Hospital Road, Upper Hill"
